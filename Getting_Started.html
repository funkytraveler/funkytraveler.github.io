        <p class="">The first step to access
our new cloud-based trading environment is to create a user account.
Simply access our home page, click the register button and enter
your name, email address, and create a password. You will receive
a notice in your email that your account is now active.</p>

        <h3 class="LabelHead">Joining a Company</h3>
        <p class="">The next step involves linking
your account to the Clearing Firm. Login to your account and select
the Settings gear icon. Select Invitations to view and accept any
pending invites from your Clearing Firm. Once accepted, your account
is fully activated and you can immediately begin to trade.</p>
        <p class="">Note:
Issues with accessing market data may indicate that the firm needs
to complete your risk setup. Please contact your Clearing Firm if
you experience issues on your first login attempt.</p>
